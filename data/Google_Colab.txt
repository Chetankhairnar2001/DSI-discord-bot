 # Common problems with Google-Colab
- Limited computation resources: You can also optimize your code to make it more memory-efficient and to utilize resources more effectively
- Session timeouts: Regularly save your work and create backups. Periodically interact with the notebook to prevent session timeouts
- Dependency management: You can install custom dependencies by using !pip install or !apt-get install commands within the notebook.
- Data transfer limitations: Use Google Drive for seamless data transfer between your computer and the notebook. Mounting your Google Drive can make data sharing more convenient.
- Collaboration limitations: Use version control systems like Git in combination with Google Colab. This allows for seamless collaboration and version management.
- Limited support for hardware: If your project requires specific hardware, consider using other cloud computing platforms that offer the required hardware support.
- Limited persistence: Save your work regularly and back up your data to prevent loss. You can also use cloud storage services like Google Drive, GitHub, or Dropbox for backup.
