#Error saying that m is not defined (in the line result = m.query(path))
- Make a seperate python file for my query function and the response cleaning function. 
The query function  just gets the response from huggingface and m.cleanResult changes it 
from a json response format to a list. After that is change m.whatever to the name of 
your function (without the m). 
- Example code: 
`if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            # sanitizes and locally saves the image while the session is running
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
            # inference api call returns string
            genre_guess = query(f'uploads/{filename}')
def query(filename):
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    etc...
    return response.json()

#Why we founded AI Camp?
- Open doors, for our students, for you as well.

#What does that mean by opening doors?
- Education without an economical outcome is an empty promise. 
The biggest problem of education is everything seems to work. 

#Do you think our current curriculum is opening doors?
- creating products yes, skills, perhaps needs to be updated, then get to hey, 
you need to build products/projects that have relevant information for yourself and for your students. 
The curriculum is only a guideline. Make some GPT related products! Show something amazing. 

#What does this mean for me? Can this experience open doors for me?
- Soft skills (leadership, planning, communication, epically if you are F1)
hard skills (LLM stuff), right now itâ€™s a critical time. 10X your abilities. 
future opportunities. Gokul example. network. All our network etc. Recommendations etc.

#Do I need to teach the exact curriculum?
- The curriculum is a guide, not a bible.
Feel free to adjust and make changes to the curriculum, especially in the next two weeks before teaching starts! 
Teaching takes some getting used to, especially if you haven't done it before, 
so if you're excited about the curriculum and the curriculum makes sense to you, 
it'll make your experience all the more fun.

#What does each team need?
- Each team needs to elect one person to: Give a short elevator speech for their three-week track in 5-6 minutes. 
Go through the schedule at a super high level (i.e., in the first half of the week the students will be working 
on XYZ, in the second half the students will be working on ABC)
