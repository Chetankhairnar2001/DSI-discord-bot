#Error saying that m is not defined (in the line result = m.query(path))
- Make a seperate python file for my query function and the response cleaning function. 
The query function  just gets the response from huggingface and m.cleanResult changes it 
from a json response format to a list. After that is change m.whatever to the name of 
your function (without the m). 
- Example code: 
`if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            # sanitizes and locally saves the image while the session is running
            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
            file.save(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))
            # inference api call returns string
            genre_guess = query(f'uploads/{filename}')
def query(filename):
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    etc...
    return response.json()

#Why we founded AI Camp?
- Open doors, for our students, for you as well.

#What does that mean by opening doors?
- Education without an economical outcome is an empty promise. 
The biggest problem of education is everything seems to work. 

#Do you think our current curriculum is opening doors?
- creating products yes, skills, perhaps needs to be updated, then get to hey, 
you need to build products/projects that have relevant information for yourself and for your students. 
The curriculum is only a guideline. Make some GPT related products! Show something amazing. 

#What does this mean for me? Can this experience open doors for me?
- Soft skills (leadership, planning, communication, epically if you are F1)
hard skills (LLM stuff), right now itâ€™s a critical time. 10X your abilities. 
future opportunities. Gokul example. network. All our network etc. Recommendations etc.

#Do I need to teach the exact curriculum?
- The curriculum is a guide, not a bible.
Feel free to adjust and make changes to the curriculum, especially in the next two weeks before teaching starts! 
Teaching takes some getting used to, especially if you haven't done it before, 
so if you're excited about the curriculum and the curriculum makes sense to you, 
it'll make your experience all the more fun.

#What does each team need?
- Each team needs to elect one person to: Give a short elevator speech for their three-week track in 5-6 minutes. 
Go through the schedule at a super high level (i.e., in the first half of the week the students will be working 
on XYZ, in the second half the students will be working on ABC)

#We are having Discord setup issues with AI Camp bot?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXq82AxH9NA

#Is it okay if each student from a team present a part of their project in our final presentation? Or we want just a single presenter?
- Yes, Try to everyone on your team to speak if possible.

#Also, what's the total time allocated for a team to present?
- Keep each presentation under 8 minutes.

#What should I do if one of the students cannot see the discord channel for their class?
- Assuming that the student has linked their discord account on app.ai-camp.dev, you should be able to use the `/class add-student` to address the issue.

#Is it ok the meet with students' parents through zoom?
- Yes. If a student's parents have contacted you wanting to know things such as the students progress and you are comfortable with contacting them, you may do so.

#Guided Internship nominations
- Write out information for all students

#Promoting communication within groups 
**if your group has some or all students who are shy**
- Try splitting your group into smaller groups of 2-3 students, and shuffle students around for different activities
- Give more talkative students leadership roles to have more efficient communication

#Explaining programming concepts
**if students are having trouble getting concepts**
- for higher level concepts, try giving more technical explanations for the advanced students, and then explain the concept in a simpler and easier to understand way for the less experienced students
- Let students struggle with problems for a bit, and then give solutions after

#Different ways of Working with less experienced students
**For coding activities:**
- Start off working through coding problems as a group, and slowly allow them to be more independent and build confidence.
- Go through the fundamentals necessary to understanding the problem and how it works, and then let students tackle it individually.
- Split the students into smaller groups based on your assessment of the level of their coding experience to ensure students are not bored or left out.
- Encourage students to privately message you questions or answers to the coding activity to prevent embarassment from not getting concepts right away.
- Ensure each student has necessary support and guidance. Try having students who have completed the activity to share their screen and explain their problem-solving.
- Pair experienced students with beginners so the novices can learn from their more knowledgeable peers.
