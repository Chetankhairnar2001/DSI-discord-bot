# Student Discord Setup Guide
- If a student is UNDER 13, they should NOT join discord
- Use the following link to invite them to the server https://discord.gg/VHS7WuJUrF
- They will be prompted to verify their phone number and email; the #verify channel turns to #no access when successfully verified
- Have them click Link Discord at https://app.ai-camp.dev/dashboard/account
- Click on the  button, and they will be redirected to a log in page. 
- Login to complete the discord linking. If they donâ€™t see the link discord option when they refresh the dashboard they are good to go. 
- If set up prior to camp, they will be added to the group on the first day, otherwise use the add student command

# Student Attendance Policy
- Your responsibilities are simply to mark student when absent and bring them up to speed upon their return (work with your lead if this occurs). 
- Wait five minutes for a student to appear before marking them absent.
- Students marked absent are handled to the # of absences:
1 Email to Student and Parents
2 Text to Student and Parents
3 Flagged for removal from course
- Suggestion: when you meet with your students, ensure their availability, set expectations as well,
- Missing students: either will show up, or be cancelled or switched to another batch. Support will notify you if that occurs

# Your Roles
Lead DSIs:
- Facilitate learning by leading lectures and organizing curriculum for team of DSIs to succeed.
- Cultivate an interactive, safe, and engaging learning environment 
- Lead by example by delivering a successful project with your team.
DSIs:
- Lead your team to success on their project
- Cultivate an interactive, safe, and engaging learning environment 
- Share your knowledge and enthusiasm of AI topics with your students 

# Message to the Students
**If You Are Struggling With Class Material**
1. Ask your mentor for help. They are there to ensure your success. If you don't understand a concept, ask your mentor for assistance after class.
2. Do your own research online. Don't underestimate what you can learn independently. If you're stuck, ask questions in the #general chat where many people are willing to help.
3. Stay motivated! Complex concepts become clearer with time. Students often make significant progress towards the end of camp. You can do it, and we look forward to seeing what you create.

# Final Project
DSIs should choose datasets proactively with their teams. Emphasize the need for datasets with a substantial amount of data and reasonable quality.

DSIs should research and ensure that their dataset can be cleaned for the following purposes:
- Creating 5-6 visualizations.
- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Drawing data-backed conclusions and summarizing key findings.
- Testing hypotheses using Machine Learning (ML).
**Important:** Discuss with the team whether to pursue supervised machine learning, selecting a suitable dataset. Activities for learning will be provided if the dataset isn't a good fit for supervised ML.
