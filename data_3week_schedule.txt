Give a demo: On how to find datasets if not done yet

As an instructor, you will need to rule out any datasets that are not in scope with your teamâ€™s programming ability. Talk to your team about whether they want to pursue supervised machine learning, and be sure to choose a fitting dataset for this.

Split your teams into pairs and let them choose one of the remaining candidate datasets to explore. 

 | 1. Talk about the plan for today, one or two volunteers present their graphs. Briefly share something from the https://www.notion.so/d738182be1004db58d73da45b68efb69?pvs=21 page.

[Group]

3. Discuss with students what type of SML problem their datasets could relate to (classification or regression). Are they good candidates for SML? USML? Where do you want to take this project? Should you focus on explore the data to understand the underlying patterns rather than using machine learning to predict a new outcome?

 | 1. Talk through plan for day. Briefly share something from the https://www.notion.so/d738182be1004db58d73da45b68efb69?pvs=21 page.

Give camper kudos to any leaders on your team for today! | Project Planning:
Work to define 2-3 themes of data for your team (e.g. sustainability, career comparison, medical, etc.). Give your team some suggestions of finding high quality data and gather 3-4 supervised ML or EDA candidate datasets with your team that are good quality.

Then, split students into pairs, each pair finds 1-2 more datasets in .csv format based on your theme and sends it to you (you will need to keep this somewhere safe). From here, you should have a lot to choose from and should end your day with 6-8 datasets to choose from.
